# Credit Risk Prediction App

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts the probability of loan default based on borrower financial details.  
Includes data analysis, logistic regression model training, and a Streamlit web app for live predictions.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes credit risk using financial and credit-related features such as:

- Credit lines outstanding  
- Loan amount and total debt  
- Income level  
- Employment stability  
- Credit score  
- Debt-to-income ratio  

The trained Logistic Regression model predicts whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan.

- Pandas / NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (EDA)  
- Streamlit (Deployment)

## Key Insights from Analysis

- Higher debt-to-income ratio strongly correlates with default risk.  
- Lower credit score increases probability of default.  
- Income alone is not a strong predictor.  
- Employment stability contributes to risk assessment.
